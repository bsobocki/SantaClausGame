## A bit about the game
It's Christmas time. Who loves this special time? Kids, of course!  
They always want to see Santa!  

Santa have a mission.  He must give a gift to every child, but it is not so simple. Children watch him and try to catch him in the act, so he must run away from they.  

However, every child gets tired one moment and goes to sleep.  

In that moment Santa can be invisible for sleeping child, so it's the one moment, when he can give a present to him.  

Help Santa give out gifts!

## How to play
You are Santa and you must give out gifts.  

Aftter sleeping kids are looking around them.  
1. They are looking for a gift. Is it on the next board tile? Great! Now they are happy, that they have a new toy, so they don't chasing you!
2. If there's no gift they try to catch Sanda. If you are on the next board tile when the kid is awakened... You lose :(
