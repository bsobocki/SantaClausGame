## A bit about the game
It's Christmas time. Who loves this special time? Kids, of course!  
They always want to see Santa!  

Santa have a mission.  He must give a gift to every child, but it is not so simple. Children watch him and try to catch him in the act, so he must run away from they.  

However, every child gets tired one moment and goes to sleep.  

In that moment Santa can be invisible for sleeping child, so it's the one moment, when he can give a present to him.
